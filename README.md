## Summary
This project is to show semantic HTML tagging. We were given an html document consiting mainly of `div`s with specific css classes. 

The goal of the project was to replace those class-ed `div`s with the correct semantic tags to both remove the redundancy of the clases and allow for more SEO by converying the relevant contextual information of our doc.
