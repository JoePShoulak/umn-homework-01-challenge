## Summary
This project is to show semantic HTML tagging. We were given an html document consiting mainly of `div`s with specific css classes. 

The goal of the project was to replace those class-ed `div`s with the correct semantic tags to both remove the redundancy of the clases and allow for more SEO by converying the relevant contextual information of our doc. 

All of this was done without changing the layout or presentation of the site, demonstrating that correct semantic tags and appealing grahpical layouts are buth important and must be adhered to in tandem.
